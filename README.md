# Scout Analytics MVP - Clean v2.1 Branch

A production-ready analytics dashboard built on a clean v2.1 baseline with cherry-picked MVP dashboard components.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository represents a safe, no-nonsense approach to integrating the Scout Analytics MVP dashboard into a clean v2.1 branch without re-introducing v3.x complexity. The implementation follows the exact sequence outlined in the deployment guide to ensure stability and maintainability.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🔧 Features

### Dashboard Components
- **GlobalFilterBar**: Advanced filtering interface with:
  - Search functionality
  - Date range picker with persistence
  - Location, category, brand, and store filters
  - Quick filter buttons (Top Performers, New Products, Trending)
  - Clear all functionality
  - Real-time filter state management

### Technical Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Date handling** with proper serialization

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

### Configuration

The project uses:
- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
- **Path aliases** (`@/` maps to `src/`)
- **Vite** with React plugin and path resolution
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Why This Approach is Safe

1. **Fork once, never track v3.x chaos** - Cherry-picked a single stable commit, not the whole history
2. **No submodules** - Everything lives inside the main repo, avoiding submodule drift
3. **Clean baseline** - Built on v2.1 foundation with minimal dependencies
4. **Production-ready** - Includes proper TypeScript configuration and build optimization

### Build Verification

The repository includes:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors
- ✅ Vite build process completing successfully
- ✅ All imports and dependencies resolved
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:5173/

## 📊 Performance

Performance testing results are stored in `performance-results/` directory, including:
- Performance reports with detailed metrics
- Summary markdown files for easy review

## 🚀 Deployment

### Preview Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to preview URL (requires Vercel CLI)
vercel deploy --prebuilt --scope ai-agency
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy to production
npm run build
vercel --prod --confirm
```

## 🔄 Git History

The repository maintains a clean git history:

1. **Initial commit**: Clean v2.1 baseline initialization
2. **Cherry-pick commit**: MVP dashboard code integration (commit `527c924`)
3. **Configuration commit**: TypeScript, Vite, and React setup

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Minor React warning about `key` prop in QuickFilterButton component (non-breaking)
- Tailwind CSS content configuration warning (styling still works correctly)

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Add tests** - Implement unit and integration tests
2. **Enhance styling** - Configure Tailwind content sources
3. **Add data integration** - Connect to real data sources
4. **Performance optimization** - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
